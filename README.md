<h2> SGM VARIANTS </h2>
<p>This is a showcase of all 42 Variants I added to SGM.</p>
<p>Each of these variants had 2 Signature Abilities, altered Stats and different Element types that made them wholly unique to other Character Variants.</p>
<p>Additionally, higher rarity variants came with unique Visual Flourishes. Examples can be found here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwFHLaNsHsM">1</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/9sA8Di9PE-4">2</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/Oa85PSxzB8Y">3</a>.</p>
